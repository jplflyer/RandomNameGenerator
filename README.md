# RandomNameGenerator
A C++ Random Name Generator.

# Requires Libraries
I use my ShowLib library plus this: https://github.com/Neargye/magic_enum.git. To install, you can `sudo make install-magic-enum`.

# Taken From
I found a variety of Random Name Generator projects beginning with this one: [https://github.com/folkengine/random_name_generator](https://github.com/folkengine/random_name_generator). The same person has several written in various languages, including Java. I have taken no code from his projects, but I did grab some of the text files he uses for various generators.

# License
My C++ code can use (your choice) the LGPL or the MIT license.

Folk Engine's text files are in the LGPL. I very carefully grabbed copies from his Ruby version, which uses the LGPL license, rather than the C++ one, which falls under the GPL.

I used his text files to generate C++ code using the program in this Repo. I don't know what legal liability that gives me for the resulting output. Is it mine? to license however I want? Or does it have to retain the LGPL?
